Spam emails pose significant challenges to digital communication by cluttering inboxes, wasting user time, and sometimes posing security threats through phishing or malicious links. To address this issue, we are developing a machine learning model that detects and classifies email messages into spam or not spam by building a robust classification system that distinguishes between valid and spam messages. The final goal of the project is to implement a user-facing interface where the trained model can be used in real-time to classify new messages.
